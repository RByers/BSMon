- Take the first item on the todo list in TODO.md
- Design a plan for solving it
- Once the user agrees and switches to act mode, iterate on the solution until it is complete, clean, adds any appropriate new tests and passes all tests.
- Then remove the item from the TODO list, propose a commit message for the work and stop, letting the user review and modify changes before committing.
- Do not operate on any other TODO items, focus just on the first one on the list.
